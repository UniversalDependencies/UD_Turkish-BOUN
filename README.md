# Summary

A Turkish treebank annotated at the Boğaziçi University.

# Introduction

The treebank is a product of a project on Turkish dependency parsing supported by TUBİTAK (The scientific and technological research council of Turkey). In addition to new material, it contains alternative annotations of certain controversial grammatical constructions in sentences that also appear in the other Turkish UD treebank, Turkish-IMST.
