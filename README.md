# Introduction

This is a newly introduced Turkish dependency treebank in the Universal Dependencies (UD) annotation style. The BOUN Treebank is created by the [TABILAB](http://http://tabilab.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/) and supported by the Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) under grant number 117E971.
